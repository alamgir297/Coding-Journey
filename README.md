# 🚀 Coding Journey

Welcome to my **Coding Journey**! This repository is a collection of all the code I've written over time, covering **problem-solving,
learning different programming languages, and various projects**. It serves as a personal archive of my progress in programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repo is organized into different categories for easier navigation:

### 🏆 Problem-Solving  
Contains my competitive programming and algorithmic problem-solving codes from various platforms. The structure is as follows:  
- **`Problem-Solving/Codeforces/`** – Solutions to Codeforces problems.  
- **`Problem-Solving/UVa/`** – UVa problem solutions.  
- **`Problem-Solving/CSES/`** – CSES problem set solutions.  
- **`Problem-Solving/Contests/`** – Codes from live and virtual contests.  
- **`Problem-Solving/graphs problems/`** – graph related problems.
- 
### 📖 Learning  
This section contains my exploration of different programming languages and concepts:  
- **`Learning/C/`** – Started with learning c  
- **`Learning/C++/`** – Learning and practice codes in C++.  
- **`Learning/Java/`** – Java programs, including OOP concepts.  
- **`Learning/C#/`** – C# and Unity-related learning projects.    
- **`Learning/OOP-Concepts/`** – Object-Oriented Programming exercises.  

🛠️ Projects
This section includes various projects I’ve worked on, ranging from database-driven applications to software development and web-based tools.

📌 DBMS & DDBMS Projects:
DBMS-Food_Hub/ 🍔 – A database management system for a food ordering platform.
DDBMS-SmartLib/ 📚 – A distributed database system for managing a digital library.
🖥️ Software Development Projects (SDP):
SDP 1 - Trivia Game (C) 🎲 – A trivia-based game written in C.
SDP 2 - Mess Manager (Java) 🍽️ – A Java-based application to manage a student mess system.
SDP 3 - Typhoon ⌨️ – A web-based typing speed test to measure and improve typing accuracy.
⚠ Note: My game development projects (Unity-based) are in separate repositories. If you're interested in them, check out those repos on my profile! 🎮

## ⚠️ Notes  
🔹 Most of the **problem-solving codes follow competitive programming conventions**, meaning **short variable names and minimal comments** (speed > readability).  
🔹 Some codes may **not be optimized** but are included to showcase my journey.  
🔹 This repo contains **all levels of codes** (from basic syntax tests to complex problems).

## ⭐ Why I Created This Repo  
I wanted to **document my entire coding journey**—from solving my first problems to working on larger projects.
This is not a curated showcase but rather a **history of my learning and progress** in programming.  

📌 Why Upload Now?
I started coding around mid-2021, but I never uploaded my work before. This repository is a way to document my journey, 
showcasing everything I’ve learned and worked on over time. Some of these codes might be unpolished, but they represent my growth in programming.
I’ve included everything, even the earliest and simplest codes, because they are part of my learning process.
Some of the problem-solving codes may lack comments or follow competitive programming conventions, but that reflects the mindset needed in that field.
This repo serves as a personal milestone, a reference for myself, and maybe even an inspiration for others starting their own journey.
